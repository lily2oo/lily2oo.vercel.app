        壁の外は危険にまみれている。それでも外へ行った彼の心情を私たちは測りかねていた。\n\n\
        「ここは十分快適だよね。」「ご飯もあるし。」「寂しくもない。」「ここからでも外の世界は見えるし。」「彼は変わってるんだよ。」\n\n\
        吐き出した言葉で少し不透明になった視界に、僕は少しの酩酊感を覚える。苦しくなって、僕は言った。\n\n\
        「僕はもう寝るよ。」\n\n\
        みんなから逃げるように、必死に尾びれを動かした。少し経って、後ろを振り返る。みんなはもう見えない。僕は溜め込んだ泡を吐き出した。僕のこの漠然とした恐怖は、誰にあてたものなんだろう。尾びれが水の壁を押しのけるたびに酔いが覚めて、気持ちがいい。気がつくと寝床はすぐそこまで来ていた。\n\n\
        「今日はこのままもう少し泳ぎたいなあ。」\n\n\
        自分の寝床におやすみの挨拶を言い残し、僕は彼がよく寝ていた岩陰に行くことにした。いつものようにそこにある彼の寝床は、がらんどうになった寂しさを漂わせている。僕は中に入って、石に頬をあてた。ひんやりして気持ちがいい。そのまま、まぶたを閉じるけれど、彼の言葉が頭の中をぐるぐる巡って、なかなか眠れない。\n\n\
        「ぼくもいっしょにいけばよかった。」\n\n\
        だれもいない岩陰の中に僕の声は木霊した。まぶたを開くと、壁の外を泳ぐ発光性のクラゲがこちらを見つめていた。"

        lang: "en",
        sentence: "Hello everyone, I’m Jumpei Suko and I’d like to present to you about my Wheel of Life. \n\
        First, I’d like to talk about my hub. My hub represents Japanese festivals as a metaphor for my emotions and personality. I believe that human beings are strongly influenced by the scenery they have seen and that the scenery evokes feelings they have experienced in the past. I titled my work '情景反射','scenic reflection' by combining the word '条件反射', 'conditional reflection' with the meaning of the word. I also chose Japanese festivals as a motif because I thought they are special but appropriate for everyday scenery. In addition, there is a back and front side to my hub because I believe there is no such thing as a person without many sides. The red is an extroverted side while the blue is an introverted side. In both cases, a candy apple is placed in the center. This is because the apple is a fruit associated with beginnings and because events often occur in my life that are triggered by apples.\n\
        Next, I’d like to talk about my six realms. \n\
        The first realm represents interest and the motif is a soda called “ramune” in Japan. I am enthusiastic when I am interested in something new, but I lose interest quickly, which is represented as carbonation.\n\
        The second realm represents vanity and the motif is the goldfish. It represents me maintaining a façade in front of others but my self-esteem is low. Goldfish are creatures created by human beings through breeding for ornamental purposes. I chose the goldfish as a motif because I thought it resembled the way humans try to make themselves look good.\n\
        The third realm represents spaciousness, and the motif is the blank space. It shows a big difference inside when there is room as opposed to when there isn’t any. It also represents to others that I appear to be a person who has blank space.\n\
        The fourth realm represents delicacy, and its motif is fireworks. I have a very sensitive side and a rough side, and I am sensitive to relationships.\n\
        The fifth realm represents health and the motif is the yukata pattern. I believe that to live a healthy life means to live a life that takes care of oneself. Wearing a yukata is healthy in that sense, so I chose yukata as the motif. It represents being passionate towards others but cold towards oneself.\n\
        The sixth realm/last realm represents instability and the motif is a water balloon. I believe that human beings are unstable creatures. Both externally and inwardly, it appears unstable, but it represents fluidity.\n\
        Finally, the rim represents the persona and the emotion.\n\
        The masks represent persona and the circles represent emotions. It also represents the fact that I have little understanding of my emotions. Just as everyone wears a mask in front of others because life is hard, I live my life wearing different masks such as a teacher, a student, and a friend.\n\
        In conclusion, my hub represents my emotions and personality. A human is very complex, so I don’t represent just one side. What I've described so far is not all of my hub, not all of my inside, and what I perceive is not all of me. If this presentation made you feel like a completely different person, that would also be true. Please share your thoughts after listening to this presentation.\n\
        Thank you for listening to my presentation. "
